# Image Segmentation and Object Identification Pipeline

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for image segmentation, object extraction, identification, and attribute summarization using advanced machine learning techniques. The workflow involves uploading an image, segmenting it, extracting objects, identifying those objects with a YOLOv5 model, and summarizing the attributes of the identified objects.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-segmentation-object-identification.git
   cd image-segmentation-object-identification
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required dependencies: Make sure you have pip installed. You can then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Upload an Image:

Use the web interface to upload an image (in formats such as .jpg, .jpeg, or .png).
Image Segmentation:

The application will automatically segment the uploaded image.
Object Extraction:

Extracted objects will be displayed along with their IDs.
Object Identification:

Each extracted object will be identified using the YOLOv5 model, with labels and confidence scores displayed.
Attribute Summarization:

The application summarizes the attributes of identified objects, which can be viewed on the UI.
Final Output:

A final output image with annotations and a data table will be generated and displayed.
How to Run the Application
Run the Streamlit app: Navigate to the project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open in Browser: After running the command, the terminal will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) that you can open in your web browser to access the application.
