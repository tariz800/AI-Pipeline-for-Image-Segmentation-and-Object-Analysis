# AI-Pipeline-for-Image-Segmentation-and-Object-Analysis


This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for image segmentation, object extraction, identification, and attribute summarization using advanced machine learning techniques. The workflow involves uploading an image, segmenting it, extracting objects, identifying those objects with a YOLOv5 model, and summarizing the attributes of the identified objects.
